# Rating Platform Experimental Design Review

This document states the current Cloudflare-delivered rating-task design from the perspective of a critical psycholinguistics reviewer. It uses placeholders because the final stimulus set is still under preparation.

## Reviewer Position

The current design is defensible only if the following distinction is maintained throughout the implementation, documentation, export files, and statistical model:

- `ENG` is a native-speaker natural reference condition. It is not an accented condition.
- `JPN` and `CHN` are nonnative-speaker groups with two pronunciation conditions: `natural` and `accented`.
- The primary pronunciation contrast is therefore within `JPN` and `CHN`; `ENG` should be used as a reference baseline, not as one level of the same accentedness manipulation.

A reviewer would reject a design that labels `ENG` as `accented`, because that would collapse native-speaker status and pronunciation condition into an incoherent factor.

## Current Task Structure

Participants complete a browser-based word-level listening task delivered through Cloudflare Pages, Pages Functions, and D1.

Main measures:

- Accentedness rating, 1-9.
- Comprehensibility rating, 1-9.
- Intelligibility response, typed word.
- Main-trial response-time and event metadata.
- Required Japanese and Chinese familiarity ratings.

Each participant completes:

1. The required background questionnaire and familiarity ratings.
2. Five browser-based practice/calibration trials.
3. Four main stimulus-list blocks.
4. A short arithmetic distractor task between Blocks 1-3.
5. Completion and D1 persistence checks.

The main task is fixed to a combined-trial format: the participant hears one audio token and then provides intelligibility, accentedness, and comprehensibility responses for that token. On the rating page, accentedness is displayed above comprehensibility. If the word cannot be identified, the participant can explicitly mark `I could not identify the word` rather than entering a forced guess.

The v0.10 data contract distinguishes participant experience from persisted research data. v0.10.2 and v0.10.1 participants complete the same five-item `practice_calibration_v0.10.1` set and receive feedback/replay UI, but a new session stores exactly 100 main assignments with `sessions.trial_count=100`. Practice assignments, responses, and events are not written to D1 or the local rating CSV, and completion covers only the 100 main trials plus the required final checklist. All background responses are stored once on the `sessions` row rather than copied into trial records. The questionnaire columns remain nullable for sessions created before the questionnaire; new sessions must provide the required values.

## Placeholder Stimulus Universe

Until final stimuli are ready, the design assumes 50 lexical items:

```text
word001, word002, ..., word050
```

The final manifest must replace these placeholders with actual target words and audio paths while preserving the same slot structure:

```csv
audio_file,audio_url,target_word,participant_id,l1_condition,pronunciation_condition,stimulus_list,word_number,condition,talker,take_number,spoken_form,practice_note
```

Required labels:

- `l1_condition`: `ENG`, `JPN`, or `CHN`.
- `pronunciation_condition`:
  - `ENG`: `natural`.
  - `JPN`: `natural` or `accented`.
  - `CHN`: `natural` or `accented`.
- `stimulus_list`: `A` through `J`.
- `word_number`: integer 1-50.

Minimum slot coverage for the production manifest:

| L1 | Pronunciation | Required per list | Required across A-J |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| ENG | natural | 5 | 50 |
| JPN | natural | 10 | 100 |
| JPN | accented | 10 | 100 |
| CHN | natural | 10 | 100 |
| CHN | accented | 10 | 100 |

The table gives the minimum number of selectable slots, not necessarily the number of unique speakers. If multiple recordings are available for a slot, the server chooses one deterministically from the participant/session seed.

## Counterbalancing Cells

The server assigns each participant to 1 of 20 cells:

- 10 list combinations: `ABCD`, `BCDE`, `CDEF`, `DEFG`, `EFGH`, `FGHI`, `GHIJ`, `HIJA`, `IJAB`, `JABC`.
- 2 pronunciation styles: `a`, `b`.

The list combination is also the block order. Example:

```text
Cell 1: ABCD, style a
Block 1: List A, 25 trials
Distractor
Block 2: List B, 25 trials
Distractor
Block 3: List C, 25 trials
Distractor
Block 4: List D, 25 trials
```

Across the 20 cells, each list appears twice in each block position. This is necessary because otherwise list identity would be confounded with fatigue, practice, or adaptation.

## Within-Participant Exposure

Each participant receives 100 main trials:

| Unit | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Blocks | 4 |
| Trials per block | 25 |
| Main trials total | 100 |
| ENG natural trials | 20 |
| JPN natural trials | 20 |
| JPN accented trials | 20 |
| CHN natural trials | 20 |
| CHN accented trials | 20 |

Each block contains:

| Condition | Count per block |
| --- | ---: |
| ENG natural | 5 |
| JPN natural | 5 |
| JPN accented | 5 |
| CHN natural | 5 |
| CHN accented | 5 |

This block-level balance is important. If the first two blocks were mostly or entirely natural, participants could recalibrate their rating scale before hearing accented tokens. The current design prevents that: every block contains all five analytic cells.

## Pronunciation Style A/B

For `JPN` and `CHN`, each list supplies 10 word-number positions per L1 group. Style `a` assigns positions 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 within that list to `natural`; positions 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 are `accented`. Style `b` reverses this mapping.

This means:

- Every participant sees equal `natural` and `accented` counts for `JPN` and `CHN` within every block.
- Across participants, each nonnative word slot can appear in both pronunciation conditions.
- The design does not rely on raw odd/even word numbers, because list ranges wrap around and would otherwise create local imbalances.

Reviewer concern:

- A/B assignment is still deterministic within list. The final stimulus set must therefore be checked for lexical imbalance across odd/even positions within each list.

Required final check:

- For every list and L1 group, compare positions assigned to style `a` natural vs style `a` accented on lexical frequency, word length, syllable count, neighborhood density, concreteness/familiarity, and phonological complexity.
- If any large imbalance remains, reorder `word_number` within the list before launch, then rerun the simulation.

Current implementation guard:

- In the production manifest, `word_number` is the CounterBalance lexical item number from `stimuli/CounterBalance.xlsx`.
- The source-audio filename value, such as `word018`, is stored separately as `source_word_number` because it reflects source recording order, not the experiment's lexical item ID.
- `scripts/validate_production_manifest.mjs` rejects manifests where one `word_number` maps to multiple `target_word` values.
- `scripts/audit_lexical_balance.py` writes lexical balance tables and `LEXICAL_BALANCE_REPORT_20260703.md`. Current local proxy metrics show no style `a`/`b` lexical imbalance at `|standardized_diff| >= 0.25`, but neighborhood density, concreteness, familiarity, and Japanese/Chinese loanword exposure still require external metadata if the team wants those reported before launch.

## Randomization

The 100 main trials are not globally shuffled. They are presented as four list blocks. Within each 25-trial block, trials are randomized.

The randomizer enforces:

- No 3 or more consecutive trials from the same L1 group.
- Fixed block size of 25.
- Fixed per-block counts for all five analytic cells.
- One versioned Sheet2 speaker pattern per 25-trial block.
- A fixed four-block pattern bundle selected by the server-side allocation, independent of the participant/session seed.

Beginning with v0.10.2, the server draws complete seeded Fisher-Yates permutations and rejects any candidate that violates the no-3 rule. It makes at most 200 attempts and then fails closed. This rejection sampler preserves the conditional distribution over admissible orders and time-reversal symmetry; it does not use the former count-pressure greedy repair that shifted most `ENG` trials into the latter part of each block. `scripts/verify_randomization_distribution.mjs` audits 50,000 deterministic blocks against exact first-position probabilities, mean position 13, forward/reverse position symmetry, JPN/CHN symmetry, order diversity, and the run constraint.

Each block's Sheet2 pattern index is saved as `speaker_pattern_index`. The expected speaker for each pre-shuffle word position is saved as `speaker_pattern_speaker`; the concrete selected stimulus still carries `participant_id` and `talker`.

## Versioned Speaker-Pattern Bundles

The current strategy is `speaker_bundle_latin_v1`. Each of the 20 list/style cells is crossed with 10 speaker-pattern bundles, creating 200 allocation microcells. The four numbers below are the Sheet2 pattern indexes for Blocks 1–4:

| Bundle | Block 1 | Block 2 | Block 3 | Block 4 |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 10 | 8 | 5 | 9 |
| 2 | 6 | 1 | 9 | 10 |
| 3 | 1 | 6 | 4 | 3 |
| 4 | 8 | 10 | 3 | 7 |
| 5 | 3 | 5 | 6 | 2 |
| 6 | 9 | 4 | 8 | 1 |
| 7 | 2 | 9 | 7 | 6 |
| 8 | 4 | 7 | 10 | 5 |
| 9 | 5 | 2 | 1 | 8 |
| 10 | 7 | 3 | 2 | 4 |

This table guarantees for every individual participant:

- Four different speaker patterns across the four blocks.
- Two odd and two even patterns.
- Every `JPN` and `CHN` speaker occurs four times: exactly two `natural` and two `accented` trials.
- Every active `ENG` reference speaker occurs four times, always `natural`.

Across one complete 200-participant cycle, every list/style cell × speaker bundle is completed once. Consequently, every word × analytic condition receives 80 ratings; every `JPN`/`CHN` word × speaker × pronunciation token receives 8 ratings; and every active `ENG` word × speaker token receives 16 ratings. These full-cycle guarantees require 200 completed participants, not merely 200 starts. Stale/dropout sessions must be finalized and replaced through rolling recruitment.

The bundle, strategy version, and server-authorized allocation cohort are saved on the session, allocation, and main assignment/trial records. Production starts fail closed if the Prolific `STUDY_ID` is not present in the server-side cohort allowlist. Legacy sessions retain `NULL` for these fields and resume their already stored assignments; they are never silently backfilled or reassigned. Historical practice assignments, trials, and events remain readable/resumable, even though v0.10 creates no new practice rows.

This is a reviewer-facing advantage over unconstrained randomization: it prevents accidental stretches such as several `JPN` or several `CHN` items in a row, which could encourage short-term adaptation or response anchoring.

Reviewer concern:

- Constrained randomization is not unconstrained randomization. The manuscript should state the no-3 rule and seeded rejection procedure explicitly and include `trial_index`, `block_index`, and possibly previous-trial L1 as process covariates or sensitivity checks.

## Distractor Task

The distractor is placed between Blocks 1-3. Its purpose is to reduce carryover from one stimulus list to the next, especially adaptation to speakers, words, and accent patterns.

Current implementation:

- Arithmetic distractor after Blocks 1, 2, and 3.
- Completion, accuracy, responses, and response time are saved in `event_logs`.

Reviewer concern:

- A distractor does not fully erase adaptation. It only makes the block transition less continuous.
- The distractor must be brief enough not to introduce large fatigue, but difficult enough to interrupt phonological rehearsal.

Recommended placeholder rule:

- `[PLACEHOLDER_DISTRACTOR_COUNT] = 6` arithmetic problems.
- Exclude or flag participants with very low distractor accuracy only if this rule is preregistered.
- Do not tune the distractor after looking at outcome data.

## Participant Allocation

The Cloudflare server balances cells by completed sessions. If completed counts are tied, it uses assigned/start counts as a secondary criterion.

This is stronger than participant-ID parity:

- Prolific IDs are not guaranteed to be numeric.
- Recruitment waves can make deterministic parity assignment uneven.
- Completion-balanced allocation handles dropout better.
- Rolling recruitment to a completed-session target can restore completed cell balance after ordinary dropout.

Reviewer concern:

- If a fixed batch is launched and recruitment stops before replacing dropouts, assigned counts can remain balanced while completed counts are uneven.
- If dropout correlates with cell, the final completed sample may still be uneven unless recruitment continues until each cell catches up. Report the final assigned, completed, and excluded count per cell.

Minimum reporting:

```text
cell_id, list_comb, pronunciation_style, assigned_count, completed_count, excluded_count
```

## Stimulus Validity Requirements

The final stimuli must satisfy more than file availability. A critical reviewer will ask whether ratings reflect pronunciation rather than lexical, acoustic, or speaker confounds.

### Lexical Controls

For each target word, record:

- Orthographic form.
- Phonemic transcription.
- Syllable count.
- Stress pattern.
- Word frequency.
- Word length in letters and phonemes.
- Neighborhood density or a defensible proxy.
- Concreteness/familiarity rating if available.
- Whether the word has high familiarity through Japanese or Chinese loanword exposure.

Required checks:

- No systematic lexical imbalance across `JPN natural`, `JPN accented`, `CHN natural`, and `CHN accented` slots.
- No systematic lexical imbalance across block positions.
- `ENG natural` reference words should be drawn from the same target-word universe, not a simpler or acoustically cleaner subset.

### Acoustic Controls

For every audio file, record:

- Duration.
- RMS intensity or LUFS.
- Peak amplitude.
- Sampling rate and bit depth.
- Leading/trailing silence.
- Clipping flag.
- Signal-to-noise estimate if available.
- Recording device or recording batch if relevant.

Required preprocessing:

- Normalize format across all files.
- Trim excessive leading/trailing silence consistently.
- Avoid clipping.
- Do not over-normalize in a way that removes natural speech cues relevant to accentedness.

Recommended analysis sensitivity:

- Add duration and intensity as covariates, or show that results are robust without them.

### Speaker Controls

The manifest has both `participant_id` and `talker`. These must be treated as meaningful experimental metadata.

Reviewer concern:

- If each L1/pronunciation condition is represented by only one speaker, the study cannot separate pronunciation condition from speaker identity.

Minimum defensible requirement:

- Multiple speakers per nonnative L1 group and pronunciation condition.
- Speaker IDs included in the exported data.
- Sheet2 speaker-pattern metadata included in assignment and trial exports.
- Mixed-effects models with random intercepts for rater, target word, and speaker whenever the data support them.

If the final design intentionally uses a small number of speakers, the manuscript must describe the study as stimulus-specific and avoid broad claims about L1 groups.

## Practice Trials

Practice trials use five researcher-provided calibration WAVs in ascending documented Accentedness-reference bands:

1. `appreciation`, `ENG` female, Accentedness 1–2 and Comprehensibility 1–2.
2. `pesticide`, `JPN` male, Accentedness 2–3 and Comprehensibility 1–2.
3. `quality`, `JPN` female, Accentedness 4–5 and Comprehensibility 2–3.
4. `organizer`, `CHN` female, Accentedness 4–6 and Comprehensibility 5–7.
5. `balloon`, `CHN` male, Accentedness 6–8 and Comprehensibility 4–6.

These are collaborator-reviewed reference ranges rather than exact scalar ratings. Before production launch:

- Present a pre-practice explanation stating that the five samples familiarize participants with the task procedure and calibrate Accentedness and Comprehensibility ratings against expert reference ranges.
- Confirm the selected practice audio by collaborator listening review.
- Preserve historical Tingting/`披萨` provenance only in the explicit v0.10.0 browser-practice registry and legacy persisted practice rows; it is not part of the current five-item set.
- Confirm both documented reference ranges; leave scalar expert fields blank because the reviewed values are ranges.
- Ensure practice words are not part of the main 50-word set.
- Ensure practice does not reveal the main experimental manipulation.
- Keep practice feedback client-only and absent from new-session assignments, trials, events, and local rating CSV rows.
- Keep practice short and main-task-like: each practice item should require word typing plus both ratings.
- Permit unlimited replay only while the post-response practice feedback is visible. Practice response pages and all main-task pages retain one playback per page.
- On reload, repeat the practice set associated with the stored session version before continuing to the saved main-trial/checklist/completion position. v0.10.2 and v0.10.1 repeat the current five items, v0.10.0 retains its historical four, and earlier persisted-practice sessions replay their saved rows. Browser-only practice creates no new persistence.
- Avoid free-text explanations during practice unless they are theoretically necessary and preregistered.

Reviewer concern:

- If practice teaches participants to map specific acoustic properties to high or low accentedness ratings, it can bias the main task. Practice should teach the interface and scale anchors, not train the experimental contrast.

## Dependent Variables

Primary outcome:

- `accentedness_1_9`.

Secondary outcomes:

- `comprehensibility_1_9`.
- `intelligibility`, preferably manually cleaned after exact-match preflagging.

Intelligibility coding should distinguish at least four states:

- Exact match: `intelligibility_exact = 1`.
- Non-exact typed response: `intelligibility_exact = 0` and `intelligibility_needs_manual_review = 1`.
- Explicitly unidentified word: `intelligibility_response_status = unidentified`, `intelligibility_unidentified = 1`, and `intelligibility_exact = 0`.
- Missing/blank response without the unidentified marker: data-quality problem, not a valid intelligibility category.

The explicit unidentified state is theoretically different from misspelling. It should not be folded into manual spelling review, although it can be analyzed as an incorrect intelligibility response.

Secondary process and quality outcomes:

- First-key response time.
- Submit response time.
- Audio replay count.
- Response-order and rating-order process fields.
- First/last selection RTs and selection counts for each 9-point rating scale.
- Distractor accuracy and response time, as attention/process indicators.

Scale direction must be reported:

- Accentedness: 1 = no accent, 9 = extremely strong accent.
- Comprehensibility: 1 = easy to understand, 9 = extremely difficult to understand.

Main-trial scoring and response-time rules must also be reported explicitly:

- Store the participant's selected Accentedness and Comprehensibility values as untransformed integers from 1 to 9. Treat them as ordinal outcomes in the primary analysis; do not use response time to modify either score.
- Preflag intelligibility by exact equality after lowercasing and removing non-letter characters. Retain non-exact typed responses for manual review, and retain an explicit unidentified response as a distinct response state.
- Measure `dictation_submit_rt_ms` and `first_key_rt_ms` from the successful word-identification playback start.
- Measure `rating_submit_rt_ms`, each scale's first and last selection RT, and the first-rating RT from the successful rating-page playback start.
- Preserve selection counts, rating interaction sequence, and first-interaction order so that changed answers and response order can be audited.
- New v0.10 sessions contain no practice rows or practice events. Historical practice rows/events from earlier versions remain excluded from confirmatory outcome, response-time, and replay analyses.

## Analysis Plan

The analysis should preserve trial-level data. Aggregating to participant means should be used only for descriptive plots or robustness checks.

Recommended primary models:

- Accentedness and comprehensibility, both required on every combined/rating trial:
  - Cumulative-link mixed model if feasible.
  - Linear mixed-effects model as a transparent robustness check.
- Intelligibility:
  - Logistic mixed-effects model.

Candidate fixed effects:

- L1/pronunciation cell:
  - `ENG natural`.
  - `JPN natural`.
  - `JPN accented`.
  - `CHN natural`.
  - `CHN accented`.
- Block index.
- Trial index within block.
- Full trial index and block position as fatigue/adaptation covariates.
- Replay count, first-response RT, first-rating RT, and rating selection counts as process/fatigue covariates.
- The displayed rating order is fixed as accentedness followed by comprehensibility. The saved `rating_order` records the participant's actual first interactions and may be used as a process diagnostic or sensitivity variable, but not as a randomized causal order effect.
- Japanese familiarity rating.
- Chinese familiarity rating.
- Audio duration and intensity if available.
- Counterbalance style.
- List or block-list identity if needed.

Candidate random effects:

- Rater.
- Target word.
- Speaker/talker.
- By-rater slopes for pronunciation cell, if supported.
- By-word slopes for L1/pronunciation cell, if supported.

Critical modeling point:

- Do not model `ENG accented`. That condition does not exist.
- Do not treat `ENG natural`, `JPN natural`, and `CHN natural` as equivalent levels of one simple nativeness factor without acknowledging that `JPN/CHN natural` are nonnative productions judged to be more natural, whereas `ENG natural` is native-speaker reference speech.

## Exclusion And Quality Rules

These rules should be preregistered before production data collection:

- Exclude incomplete sessions from primary analysis.
- Exclude sessions with server-save failures or missing trial blocks.
- Exclude participants with extreme nonresponse or invalid typed responses.
- Flag participants with implausibly short listening/response times.
- Flag participants who fail distractor criteria, if such criteria are set. Practice is not a persisted analytic measure in v0.10; any immediate UI-level practice gate would need to be specified separately.
- Decide whether high Japanese/Chinese familiarity is exclusionary or a covariate.

Do not change exclusion thresholds after looking at condition effects.

## Verification Commands

Run these before each production deployment:

```sh

```

The production manifest validator confirms that the real manifest satisfies the same slot, balance, lexical item ID, and Sheet2 speaker-pattern requirements. The bundle verifier exhaustively generates all 20 × 10 assignments and checks the participant-level 2/2 speaker guarantee and the full-cycle token counts. The concurrency stress script verifies the SQL-level 200-microcell allocation invariant under a same-timestamp start wave. The lexical, acoustic, and duration scripts write tables under `/Users/tohokusla/Dropbox/Accentedness/Stimuli_OSF_Release_20260703/metadata/`; the current reports are `LEXICAL_BALANCE_REPORT_20260703.md`, `AUDIO_QC_REPORT_20260703.md`, `DURATION_ESTIMATE_REPORT_20260703.md`, and `COUNTERBALANCE_CONCURRENCY_STRESS_20260703.md`.

The live deployment check writes `LIVE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECK_20260703.md` to the same metadata directory. Use `--allow-turnstile-off` only for pilot phases where Turnstile is intentionally disabled; omit it for the final production check if Turnstile is required.

Current acoustic QC has no launch-blocking failure after the `main/jpn/natural/jpn_s06/jpn_s06_natural_pass01_word018_capelin_take04_trial0018.wav` OSF package copy was repaired by linear interpolation across 11 full-scale samples. Before launch, still decide whether peak amplitude 0.99 remains an enforceable preprocessing target, because most main files are consistent with intensity normalization rather than peak normalization.

## Final-Stimulus Placeholder Checklist

Before launch, replace or complete:

- `[PLACEHOLDER_WORD001]` through `[PLACEHOLDER_WORD050]`.
- `[PLACEHOLDER_AUDIO_URL]` for every required slot.
- `[PLACEHOLDER_SPEAKER_ID]` and `[PLACEHOLDER_TALKER_ID]`.
- `[PLACEHOLDER_LEXICAL_METADATA]`.
- `[PLACEHOLDER_ACOUSTIC_METADATA]`.
- Practice audio and reference ranges are resolved by `practice_calibration_v0.10.1`: five reviewed WAVs with both Accentedness and Comprehensibility ranges. The v0.10.2 platform deliberately reuses that unchanged practice set.
- `[PLACEHOLDER_EXCLUSION_THRESHOLDS]`.
- `[PLACEHOLDER_TARGET_SAMPLE_SIZE]`.

The study should not be launched until the final manifest passes both software verification and a design-level audit of these placeholders.
